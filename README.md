# Service-Learning-Database
This is a service learning project for a local business Moraine fish and Chicken
The datbase is currently useable but in progress and is intended to be used by a local Dayton business for Item stock data purposes.
Custom Java forms are in work and need to be connected to the database by use of a third party.
